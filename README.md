# Milestone1

## Goals of the Milestone 

The primary goal of this milestone was to understand the process of computing Differential Expression Analysis on a set of data that is known. 
A vignette that analysed gene count data from the mouse genome was found on Bioconductor. In the sample vignette, the data was loaded into the code and combined into one matrix. 
Using the functions of glimma, limma and edgeR, the data was processed and analysed. 
In this milestone, the same analysis was carried out and published to an html page.
